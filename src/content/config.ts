/**
 * Content schema for solar-nusantara.id.
 *
 * Tightened on 2026-09-15 ahead of a planned ~1000-article build-out. The
 * guiding rule: anything the article template or the structured-data helper
 * *assumes* is present must be `required` here, so a bad article fails at
 * build time on the author's machine rather than shipping a broken page.
 *
 * Before this, `description` and `pubDate` were both `.optional()` while
 * src/pages/berita/[...slug].astro called `post.data.pubDate.toLocaleDateString()`
 * unconditionally. One dateless article would have taken down the whole build
 * with a null dereference, and an empty description shipped an empty
 * <meta name="description"> - six of the eighteen articles had exactly that.
 *
 * Lengths are not arbitrary:
 *   description 70..160  - under 70 Google usually rewrites the snippet from
 *                          page text; over 160 it truncates. Measured across
 *                          the existing 18 articles before setting the bounds
 *                          (they now run 118..155), so nothing is grandfathered.
 *   seoTitle    ..60     - the <title> is truncated around 60 characters in the
 *                          SERP. The on-page <h1> can and should stay longer and
 *                          more descriptive, so the two are separate fields
 *                          rather than one compromise string.
 *
 * NOTE: `slug` must never be added to this schema. Astro reserves it for entry
 * slug generation and throws `content-schema-contains-slug` if a collection
 * schema declares it. To override a URL, set `slug:` in the article frontmatter
 * - the schema simply must not describe it.
